# Landmine Detection Robot – CUET Robo-Fight Competition

This project was developed for a national Robo-Fight competition at CUET. It includes a landmine detection robot programmed with Arduino and a C# GUI for PC-based monitoring or control.

## 🚀 Features
- **Obstacle avoidance**
- **Metal detection** (simulated landmines)
- **Robot control via C# GUI**
- **Arduino-controlled motion logic**

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Arduino (.ino file)
- C# (Windows Forms Application in Visual Studio)
- EMGU CV for image/video processing (DLL used in GUI)

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `bot.1.00.ino` → Arduino sketch for controlling robot logic
- `GUI_MINE/` → C# project for building the GUI interface
- Exclude `/bin/` and `/obj/` from version control

## 🤝 Collaborators
This project was developed as a team effort by:

- [M A HAFIZ](https://github.com/MAHAFIZS)
- [Rahi008](https://github.com/rahi008)
